        <p>There's something special about eating at a fine restaurant. 
            The elegant waiting staff with impeccable manners, fancy cutlery, 
            aroma of expensive wine, and delicious meals give customers a sense 
            of importance. Of course, experiencing the wonderful feelings and 
            savory cuisine that accompany fine dining requires shedding some 
            cash, perhaps more than most people are willing. At many high-end
             restaurants, customers can expect to spend hundreds of dollars for 
             a meal. There are plenty of customers who are willing to pay top 
             dollar for the optimal experience. However, many others prefer 
             eating in a casual restaurant setting; the food is often 
             well-made yet far less costly. If you're thinking about 
             eating at such a restaurant, selecting the right one is crucial. 
             We're here to challenge the history, modern success, and major
              culture of both experiences at our Family owned business.

        <h2>The History of Dining</h2>
        <p>  
                C. 300 B.C.E. - 500 A.D. Food vendors and public eateries sell food on the 
                streets of Ancient Greek, Roman, and Chinese cities.
        </p>
        <p>       C. 1000-1500 A.D. Overnight inns provide food and drink to travelers and 
                locals alike. These were mostly operated out of the owner's home. 
        </p>
        <p> C. 1550 Coffee houses (cafes) are established in Constantinople.
                1782 First restaurant is established in Paris.
        </p>
        <p> 1790-1820 Beginning of the modern restaurant in post-revolution France. 
                After the war, members of the elite class sought new ways to earn money.
                 Many took advantage of their aristocratic background by opening the first
                  fine dining restaurants, where they offered the nobility's dining experience
                   for an affordable cost. The budding middle class now had money to spend,
                    and eagerly took part in the elements of aristocratic life. Fine dining
                     in Paris flourished, and quickly spread across the Atlantic.
        </p>
        <p> 1900-1960 Ideas like Henry Ford's assembly line gain popularity and 
                entrepreneurs realize the benefit of producing a high quantity of food 
                at a low price. This led to franchising and the first restaurant chains, 
                like McDonalds, White Castle, and KFC.
        </p>
        <p> 1950-1970 Casual restaurants with themes, like Taco Bell and Pizza Hut,
                 emerge after business owners realize that customers could be better 
                 catered to through specialization. 
        </p>
        <p> <em>1965 Hooligan's was established by two escaped convicts with false identities.</em>
                1970-1990 The expanding American work force and the prevalence of two 
                working parent households leads to the beginning of the casual family restaurant,
                 examples of which include Applebee's, T.G. I. Friday's, and Olive Garden.
        </p>
        <p> 2005-Present Fast casual restaurants like Qdoba, Panera Bread, and Five Guys gain 
                popularity.
